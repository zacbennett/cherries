# Cherries

> Cherries is an online earring subscription store that allows you to purchase individual earrings or a subscription. Myself and a team of three created it in three weeks as part of an internship with Lipslut. Cherries is not currently live, and my forked version will be outdated as it is continuing to be developed by Lipslut
